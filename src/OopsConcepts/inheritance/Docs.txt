The Object class is the root of the class hierarchy in Java, meaning that every class directly or indirectly inherits from it.
However, you cannot directly use super to reference the Object class in a class that directly extends Object because Object is the superclass of all classes and does not have a superclass itself.
In summary, the super keyword is used to access members of the immediate parent class in the inheritance hierarchy, but it cannot be used to refer to the Object class when a class extends it directly.
