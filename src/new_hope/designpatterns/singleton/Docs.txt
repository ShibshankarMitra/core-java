Benefits of using Singleton objects:
Simplified Access:
Provides a single point of access for all consumers, making it easier to manage and control resources.
Reduced Memory Consumption:
Since only one instance exists, it can reduce memory usage compared to creating multiple instances.
Data Integrity:
Prevents multiple instances from causing conflicts and data inconsistencies.
Centralized Control:
Allows for a single point of control over the object's lifecycle and behavior.
Drawbacks of using Singleton objects:
Reduced Testability:
Can make unit testing more difficult, as it's challenging to mock or isolate the Singleton instance.
Increased Complexity:
Can introduce unexpected complexities, especially in multi-threaded environments.
Violation of Principles:
Can violate principles like Open/Closed Principle if the Singleton class tightly couples consumers to a specific concrete implementation.
